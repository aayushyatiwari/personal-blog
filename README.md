# aayush's blog

this is where i write. tech, thoughts, whatever i'm learning.  
it's simple by choice — no fluff, no animations, no tracking.

## what’s here

- posts about machine learning, backend, vim, life
- clean html + css
- no javascript (unless i *really* need it)

## 

this is still on going because I am still learning django. i didn't mean to make this project but medium needs a subscription and i wanted to learn django at some point of the other. So. This.
