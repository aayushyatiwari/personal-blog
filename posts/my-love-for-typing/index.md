title: My love for typing (fast)

I was very small (class 12th) when I thought, "hey, people who type fast are, um, cool. Maybe I should try to type fast".

Now, one could ask, "brother, why were you not studying for JEE?" 
Well.
That's a valid question. And if you know me, you know, I didn't study for JEE T_T

I started practicing to type. I had a friend with whom I started having [typeracer.com](www.typerace.com) races. That was fun.

So, I'd like to share how you can, (if you want to ofc) learn to type fast. Trust me, it'll help.

A. Start by getting your fingers stuck to the middle row. fun fact: the bump on your keyboard on **F** and **J** are for you to put your index finger there. Now, the next step is to go to:
[keybr.com](https://keybr.com)

Finish this bad boy. Every finger, master it. Dw abt the speed rn. And whatever happens, don't look at your keyboard! That's the only rule.

B. Now, that you've completed that website. It's time we move on to the next step, which is to write nice little words.
[10fastfingers](www.10fastfingers.com) or [monkeytype](monkeytype.com)

Grind any of these. Drinking coffee? (me too btw. 24/7) give some time to the website. Type some. 

C. The last step is to type with punctuations, commas and stuff. You'll get that here.
[TypeRacer](www.typeracer.com)

This is the ultimate place. Want to feel better than everyone? Get >60wpm on this website. Trust me.
 
Well, the journey will be hard. You'll want to leave after you realize it's hard to type without looking below (at the keyboard, what did you think?). But it's always the starts that are hard.


Do it in **moderation**. Because you have a life to attend to. ATB

> “couldn't push to prod, but atleast i type at 100wpm” — some tryhard.
